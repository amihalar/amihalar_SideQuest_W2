## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 2 Example 3: Platforms (AABB Collisions)

---

## Authors

## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

When the blob jumps, changes colours from pink to yellow.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

The initial code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane. The updated code with the changes was written by ChatGPT. The changes that were made were the dynamic and colour changes to the background, the smiley face on the blob, and the change from pink to yellow when the spacebar is pressed.
